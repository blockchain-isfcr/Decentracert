## 📝 Abstract / Overview:

*DecentraCert++ — Privacy-Preserving, Non-Transferable Digital Certification System with Tiered Issuer Verification*

*DecentraCert++* is a fully decentralized platform for issuing and verifying academic or professional credentials using *Soulbound ERC-721 NFTs, enhanced by **Merkle Tree-based eligibility, **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)* for privacy-preserving attestations, and a *tiered verification system for issuers* (T1/T2 badges).

Institutions — from top universities to grassroots training centers — can issue tamper-proof digital credentials. These certificates are bound to a wallet, verifiable publicly, and upgradeable in trust level, while recipients can prove their qualifications *privately* through ZK proofs, maintaining control over what they reveal.

## 🔁 Workflow / Architecture

### 1. *Issuer Onboarding & Verification*

* Issuer selects a *verification method*:

  * *T1 (Tier 1)* — Domain ownership via DNS TXT record ✅
  * *T2 (Tier 2)* — Social post linking wallet from official org account ⚠
  * *Manual fallback* — For orgs without web/social presence (contact team)

* Based on method, issuer receives a *non-transferable verification badge NFT* (T1 or T2)

* If T2 issuer later verifies DNS, their badge is *burned and upgraded* to T1.

### 2. *Certificate Preparation*

* Issuer compiles participant wallet addresses.
* Generates *Merkle Tree root* for whitelisting.
* Deploys *Soulbound ERC-721* certificate contract with:

  * Non-transferability enforced
  * Merkle root embedded
  * Metadata template (title, date, org, etc.)

### 3. *Participant Minting*

* Recipient logs in via MetaMask.
* Provides *Merkle Proof* of eligibility.
* Contract verifies and mints *Soulbound NFT* to user’s wallet.
* Metadata (title, org, cert hash) pinned to *IPFS*.

### 4. *Privacy-Preserving ZK Verification*

* Recipient generates *ZK proof* (e.g., “I hold a valid cert from Org X”).
* Sends to verifier (e.g., employer or DAO portal).
* Verifier contract checks proof *without seeing certificate details*.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### 🔗 Smart Contracts:

* Solidity + OpenZeppelin (ERC-721 + custom soulbound logic)
* Merkle Proof verifier
* Tiered issuer registry + upgrade logic (T2 → T1)
* ZK Verifier contracts (Groth16 / SnarkJS output)

### 🔒 Privacy Layer:

* Circom for ZK circuit definitions
* SnarkJS for proof generation
* On-chain verifier contracts

### 🖥 Frontend:

* React + Tailwind CSS
* Ethers.js + MetaMask integration
* Pinata / Web3.Storage for IPFS cert storage

## 🛡 Issuer Verification Model (Integrated)

| Tier   | Method                  | Badge       | Use Case                 | Upgradeable? |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| *T1* | DNS ownership           | 🟢 T1     | Large orgs, universities | ✅            |
| *T2* | Social media proof      | 🟡 T2     | Clubs, training centers  | ✅            |
| Manual | Admin-endorsed fallback | 🟠 Manual | Rural schools, NGOs      | ⚠ Limited   |

> 🔁 If a T2 issuer later verifies DNS, the T2 badge is *burned and replaced* with a T1.

## 🎓 Example Use Case Flows

### ✅ Student Graduation Certificates

* University verifies via DNS (T1)
* Uploads grad wallet list → Merkle Tree → Cert contract deployed
* Students mint via MetaMask
* Job portal accepts ZK proofs that verify student’s degree without doxxing them

### ✅ Hackathon or Workshop Badges

* Event organizer verifies via Twitter (T2)
* Attendee list → Merkle Tree → NFT contract deployed
* Participants mint Soulbound NFTs
* Later, org verifies DNS → upgraded to T1 (badge replaced)

### ✅ Rural School (No Website or Social)

* Org contacts admin for manual verification
* Admin team reviews details and endorses issuer manually
* Issuer gets Manual Verified badge and can issue certs
